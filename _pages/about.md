<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I come from Qinghai Province. I am studying at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS), Institute of Computing Technology (ICT), and Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), majoring in Computing Technology. I majored in Simulation engineering at the Changsha Campus of the National University of Defense Technology (NUDT). After graduation, I engaged in simulation-related work. I am proficient at simulation engine construction and in discrete event simulation technology and parallel discrete event simulation technology. In addition, I am also interested in economics and finance. Now I am qualified as a certified public accountant (CPA) in China. 

My research interests mainly include large-scale network simulation technology, reinforcement learning, operations research, LEO satellite network routing technology, etc.
